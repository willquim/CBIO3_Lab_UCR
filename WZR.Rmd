**BIO**

I did my Ph.D at the University of Barcelona (UB) in the group of Prof. Javier Luque, where I obtained my doctorate with highest honors. Then, I did a Postdoctorate combining theoretical and experimental methods in computer aided drug design (CADD). I worked in the parametrization of QM-based solvation models, being one of the most accurate methods based on the results of the SAMPL Challenges. Also, I made experimental work for determining lipophilicity in drugs with the Prof. Clara Ràfols.

I was a Visitor Professor at the State University of Pará (UFPA)-Brazil (2017) and University of Barcelona (2021)

I joined the UCR and Advanced Computing National Collaboratory as early-career researcher in 2020 where I formed a research group in CADD and Computational Biology.

I currently work in interdisciplinary projects in collaboration with Experimental and Teoretical Chemists (U. of Barcelona, U. of Nebraska-USA and U. of Costa Rica), Medicinal Chemists (U. of Costa Rica & Seoul National University-Korea), Computer Scientists (TEC & CNCA-CONARE), Biologists (U. of Costa Rica), Structural Biologists (U. of Melbourne) and Microbiologists (U. of Costa Rica) and Companies (Pion Inc-UK, Pharmacelera Inc-Spain) around the world.

Dr. Zamora is currently working at:

1) Professor, School of Chemistry-UCR.
2) Professor, Faculty of Pharmacy-UCR.
3) Professor, Postgraduate Studies System in Biomedical Sciences, School of Medicine-UCR.
4) Professor, Postgraduate Studies System in Chemistry, School of Chemistry-UCR.
5) Associate Researcher, Advanced Computing Laboratory (CNCA), CONARE, Costa Rica National High Technology Center (CeNAT)
