**BIO**

Esteban have been part of the CBIO3 Group since the beginning of 2021. His current research project is carried out with my partners Sebasti치n Su침er and Kenneth L칩pez. Under the guidance of Dr. William Zamora.

Our current project consists of investigating the influence of ion formation on the lipophilicity of some small organic molecules. In short, organic molecules that have acidic (carboxylates, amides, etc.) or basic (amines, phosphines, pyridines, etc.) functional groups will exist in a balance between their neutral species and their ionic form. So, we set out to answer whether considering this ionic balance improves our lipophilicity prediction calculations. In addition, we are dedicated to answering other questions such as: Do these considerations work better for acids? Or for bases? What happens if the molecule has acidic and basic groups at the same time? Are the predictions still good at different pHs? ?, among other.

In addition, we also collaborate in projects dedicated to the application of Machine Learning to determine new lipophilicity descriptors of small molecules in collaboration with the University of Barcelona and the Pharmaceutical Development and Technology Company | Pion from the UK.

Currently, Esteban is doing a professional internship at the Electrochemical and Chemical Energy Research Center at the University of Costa Rica.

*In addition to studying* Esteban likes to do any kind of sport. He mentions that he is mediocre good at mixed martial arts, soccer, basketball, tennis, volleyball, among others. Esteban really like to dance, go out with my girlfriend, go out with friends and watch anime, YouTube, Twitch, etc.

**PRIZES AND AWARDS**

1) During 2020 and 2021, Esteban has participated as a teaching assistant in introductory laboratory courses for Chemistry students. The pandemic suddenly forced us to plan remote activities. Our initial results are reported in the Journal of Chemical Education: https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00803. Next, we present one of the practices that we designed as a poster during the virtual conference of the ACS Spring National Meeting 2021 and at the 44th Senior Technical Meeting of ACS Puerto Rico: https://doi.org/10.1021/scimeetings.1c00747.

2) During the second half of 2021, Esteban participated with my colleagues David Pacheco and Ariel Fern치ndez in the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Fair (FEDI) of the School of Chemistry of the University of Costa Rica. We created the company PROJECT SAFE. During the semester, we dedicated ourselves to designing our POLARIS product. This prototype facilitates the detection of adulterated beverages on the spot inside bars or parties.
