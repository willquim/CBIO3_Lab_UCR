Sc student working in the elaboration of biological\nlipophilicity scale for carbohydrate-based molecules under the\nsupervision of Prof. William Zamora\nTheir current project consists of investigating the influence of ion\nformation on the lipophilicity of some small organic molecules. In\nshort, organic molecules that have acidic (carboxylates, amides, etc.)\nor basic (amines, phosphines, pyridines, etc.) functional groups will\nexist in an equilibrium between their neutral species and their ionic\nform. So, they set out to answer whether considering these chemical\nequilibriums improve lipophilicity prediction calculations. In addition,\nthey dedicate to answer questions such as: Do these considerations work\nbetter for acids? Or for bases? What happens if a molecule has both\nacidic and basic groups at the same time? Are the predictions still good\nat different pHs?, among other.\nIn addition, he also collaborates in projects dedicated to the\napplication of Machine Learning to determine new lipophilicity\ndescriptors of small molecules in collaboration with the University of\nBarcelona and the Pharmaceutical Development and Technology Company |\nPion from the UK.\nIn addition to studying: Esteban likes to do any kind of sport. He\nmentions that he is mediocre good at mixed martial arts, soccer,\nbasketball, tennis, volleyball, among others. Esteban really like to\ndance, hang out with his girlfriend, go out with friends, play\nvideogames, watch anime, YouTube, Twitch, etc.\nPRIZES AND AWARDS\nDuring 2020 and 2021, Esteban participated as a teaching\nassistant in introductory laboratory courses for Chemistry students. The\npandemic suddenly forced them to plan remote activities. Their initial\nresults are reported in the Journal of Chemical Education: https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00803.\nOnto the next semester, one of the experiments they designed was\npresented as a poster during the virtual conference of the ACS Spring\nNational Meeting 2021 and at the 44th Senior Technical Meeting of ACS\nPuerto Rico: https://doi.org/10.1021/scimeetings.1c00747. It\nconsisted on a household titration of vinegar with sodium bicarbonate\nwith minimal equipment. Semi-quantitative results can be achieved, as\nwell as tons of valuable educational goals for Chemistry\nfreshmen.\nDuring the second half of 2021, Esteban participated with my\ncolleagues David Pacheco and Ariel Fernández in the Entrepreneurship and\nInnovation Fair (FEDI) of the School of Chemistry of the University of\nCosta Rica. We created the company PROJECT SAFE. During the semester, we\ndedicated ourselves to designing our POLARIS product.
