In\nshort, organic molecules that have acidic (carboxylates, amides, etc.)\nor basic (amines, phosphines, pyridines, etc.) functional groups will\nexist in an equilibrium between their neutral species and their ionic\nform. So, they set out to answer whether considering these chemical\nequilibriums improve lipophilicity prediction calculations. In addition,\nthey dedicate to answer questions such as: Do these considerations work\nbetter for acids? Or for bases? What happens if a molecule has both\nacidic and basic groups at the same time? Are the predictions still good\nat different pHs?, among other.\nIn addition, he also collaborates in projects dedicated to the\napplication of Machine Learning to determine new lipophilicity\ndescriptors of small molecules in collaboration with the University of\nBarcelona and the Pharmaceutical Development and Technology Company |\nPion from the UK.\nCurrently, Esteban is doing a professional internship at the\nElectrochemical and Chemical Energy Research Center at the University of\nCosta Rica (CELEQ).\nIn addition to studying: Esteban likes to do any kind of sport. He\nmentions that he is mediocre good at mixed martial arts, soccer,\nbasketball, tennis, volleyball, among others. Esteban really like to\ndance, hang out with his girlfriend, go out with friends, play\nvideogames, watch anime, YouTube, Twitch, etc.\nPRIZES AND AWARDS\nDuring 2020 and 2021, Esteban participated as a teaching\nassistant in introductory laboratory courses for Chemistry students. The\npandemic suddenly forced them to plan remote activities. Their initial\nresults are reported in the Journal of Chemical Education: https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00803.\nOnto the next semenster, one of the experiments they designed was\npresented as a poster during the virtual conference of the ACS Spring\nNational Meeting 2021 and at the 44th Senior Technical Meeting of ACS\nPuerto Rico: https://doi.org/10.1021/scimeetings.1c00747. It\nconsisted on a household titration of vinegar with sodium bicarbonate\nwith minimal equipment. Semi-quantitative results can be achieved, as\nwell as tons of valuable educational goals for Chemistry\nfreshmen.\nDuring the second half of 2021, Esteban participated with my\ncolleagues David Pacheco and Ariel Fernández in the Entrepreneurship and\nInnovation Fair (FEDI) of the School of Chemistry of the University of\nCosta Rica. We created the company PROJECT SAFE. During the semester, we\ndedicated ourselves to designing our POLARIS product. This prototype\nfacilitates the detection of adulterated beverages on the spot inside\nbars or parties. The prototypes can be found in this website: https://view.genial.ly/616e1a688a57760d68f41f4d/presentation-fedi-2021?fbclid=IwAR0iVl91f_3moIbDhp9da5uwn_RylpROkV3lHwARcXsn8ZZTbKoyjqGm8qI\n\n\n\n",

Silvana Pinheiro received two degrees, one in Chemistry (2009)\nand another in Pharmacy (2010) at the State University of Pará (UFPA)\nand the Center for University Studies of Pará (Brasil), respectively.\nThen, at the UFPA, she completed a Master in Science Education in 2010,\nand joined the research group of Claudio Nahum, where obtained her\nMaster in Genetics and Molecular Biology (Bioinformatics), defended in\n2012. In 2013, she was awarded a Ph.D. fellowship from the Ciência Sem\nFronteiras program (Programa de Doutorado Pleno) funded by the Conselho\nNacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) of Brazil\n(fellowship 246791/2012-8), to pursue Ph.D. studies at the University of\nBarcelona under the supervision of Dr. Carles Curutchet. Her Ph.D.,\nentitled Study of the impact of electronic polarization in\nbiomolecular interactions, focused on the investigation of the\nimpact of electronic polarization in intermolecular interactions, both\nat the ground and excited state, and in biological systems. In 2017, she\ndefended her Ph.D. at the UB.\nDra.
