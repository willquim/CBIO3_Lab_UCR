Under the guidance of Dr. William\nZamora.\nOur current project consists of investigating the influence of ion\nformation on the lipophilicity of some small organic molecules. In\nshort, organic molecules that have acidic (carboxylates, amides, etc.)\nor basic (amines, phosphines, pyridines, etc.) functional groups will\nexist in a balance between their neutral species and their ionic form.\nSo, we set out to answer whether considering this ionic balance improves\nour lipophilicity prediction calculations. In addition, we are dedicated\nto answering other questions such as: Do these considerations work\nbetter for acids? Or for bases? What happens if the molecule has acidic\nand basic groups at the same time? Are the predictions still good at\ndifferent pHs? ?, among other.\nIn addition, we also collaborate in projects dedicated to the\napplication of Machine Learning to determine new lipophilicity\ndescriptors of small molecules in collaboration with the University of\nBarcelona and the Pharmaceutical Development and Technology Company |\nPion from the UK.\nCurrently, Esteban is doing a professional internship at the\nElectrochemical and Chemical Energy Research Center at the University of\nCosta Rica.\nIn addition to studying Esteban likes to do any kind of\nsport. He mentions that he is mediocre good at mixed martial arts,\nsoccer, basketball, tennis, volleyball, among others. Esteban really\nlike to dance, go out with my girlfriend, go out with friends and watch\nanime, YouTube, Twitch, etc.\nPRIZES AND AWARDS\nDuring 2020 and 2021, Esteban has participated as a teaching\nassistant in introductory laboratory courses for Chemistry students. The\npandemic suddenly forced us to plan remote activities. Our initial\nresults are reported in the Journal of Chemical Education: https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00803. Next, we\npresent one of the practices that we designed as a poster during the\nvirtual conference of the ACS Spring National Meeting 2021 and at the\n44th Senior Technical Meeting of ACS Puerto Rico: https://doi.org/10.1021/scimeetings.1c00747.\nDuring the second half of 2021, Esteban participated with my\ncolleagues David Pacheco and Ariel Fernández in the Entrepreneurship and\nInnovation Fair (FEDI) of the School of Chemistry of the University of\nCosta Rica. We created the company PROJECT SAFE. During the semester, we\ndedicated ourselves to designing our POLARIS product. This prototype\nfacilitates the detection of adulterated beverages on the spot inside\nbars or parties.\n\n\n\n",
