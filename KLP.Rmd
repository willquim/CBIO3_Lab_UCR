**BIO**

Kenneth López Pérez, has a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry and is currently pursuing a graduate degree in Chemistry. His interests are in the application of data science and artificial intelligence to chemistry. 

In 2020, together with Dr. Zamora, they obtained an outstanding participation in the SAMPL7 (international competition for computational drug design), where they developed a model for the prediction of the partition coefficient of sulfonamides. His final graduation project aims to predict the water/n-octanol partition coefficient at different pH with Machine Learning algorithms for monoprotic and monobasic molecules. 
In addition, he is a professor in the General Chemistry Section of the School of Chemistry of the University of Costa Rica. In fall 2022, Kenneth plans to begin his doctoral studies at the University of Florida.
